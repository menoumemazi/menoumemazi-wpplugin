# Menoume Mazi Wordpress Plugin

This project aims to create a Wordpress Plugin using React.js to offer data from menoumemazi.org through wp-json API

We use shortcodes to display data, Finders as we call them.

1. For Local Solidarity Groups use [group_finder]

2. For Reports from workers use [report_finder]

3. For Unions use [union_finder]

You can also customize the title in the Finder eg. [group_finder title="My custom title"]
